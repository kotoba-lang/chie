  "The journal writer must not put a raw control byte on disk.

  A journal exists to be read. `pr-str` emits raw control bytes, and one of
  them makes `file(1)` call the log `data` and grep skip it silently:
  `grep -c :some/attr <journal>` prints nothing and exits 1 — exactly what a
  journal not containing that attribute does. Twenty files across this
  workspace were in that state on 2026-08-18, every byte load-bearing."
