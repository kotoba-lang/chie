;; etzhayyim.kotoba.query — a Datalog subset over the live EAVT triple set.
;;
;; Supports the access patterns the religious-corp actors actually use:
;;   {:find  [?sym ...]
;;    :in    [?param ...]          ; optional positional inputs
;;    :where [[?e :attr ?v]        ; data pattern (e a v); _ = wildcard
;;            [?e :other const]    ; constants bind/filter
;;            [(pred ?x ?y)]]}     ; predicate clause (allowlisted fns)
;;
;; Symbols beginning with ? are logic vars; _ is an ignored wildcard; anything
;; else is a constant. Joins are nested-loop over partially-bound clauses —
;; correct and adequate for a reference engine; kotoba-kqe is the production
;; arrangement-join path.
