(ns chie.methods.autorun
  "chie 智慧 deterministic heartbeat — 常駐化 (ADR-2606171200; pattern: ADR-2606091000 /
  mimamori autorun). One cycle = load seed → analyze (edge-primary 取-concentration) →
  aggregate coverage + opening headline → persist ONE content-addressed transaction to the
  local append-only kotoba commit-DAG.

    - NO external I/O: offline seed in, LOCAL log out. Live ingest (regulator texts /
      disclosed rounds / Wikidata) stays G7/Council-gated.
    - Deterministic + resume-safe: cycle number derives from the log length (no wall clock,
      no randomness); same seed + same cycle → byte-identical CID (kotoba.datom parity, so a
      log written here verifies under the Python impl and vice-versa).
    - N1/G2: GROUND = node + edge datoms (the graph). The per-node opening/reach/fragility
      INTEGRALS are computed on read and are NOT persisted as ground; only an AGGREGATE
      coverage tx (counts + the single top opening-priority headline) is appended — an
      observation, never a per-entity score-of-everyone.
    - G4: the schema cannot represent :trade / :forecast / :ai/score, so the heartbeat
      cannot emit them."
